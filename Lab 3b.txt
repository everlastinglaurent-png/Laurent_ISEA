What command did you use to create a new directory? 



mkdir





How can you view the contents of a file without opening it in a GUI besed text editor? 



What is the difference between cp and mv commands?



| Command  | Purpose     | What It Does                                                                                                  |

| -------- | ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |

| \*\*`cp`\*\* | Copy        | Creates a duplicate of a file or directory. The original stays in place.                                      |

| \*\*`mv`\*\* | Move/Rename | Moves a file or directory to a new location or renames it. The original is removed from its old location. |





cat file.txt



1\. What information does the free -h command provide?



The free command in Linux displays information about system memory usage, and the -h option stands for “human-readable”, which shows sizes in KB, MB, or GB instead of bytes.





2\. How can you modify the script to monitor network usage?



If you have a script monitoring memory, you can expand it to track network usage. For example, you can use Linux commands like:



ifconfig (older systems)



ip -s link (modern replacement)



/proc/net/dev (reads raw network statistics)



This calculates bytes per second transmitted and received by the interface eth0.





3\. Why is automating system monitoring beneficial for administrators?





1. Early Detection of Issues:



Alerts administrators to high CPU, memory, or disk usage before it becomes a critical problem.



2\. Consistency and Reliability:



Scripts or tools run at scheduled intervals (cron jobs, systemd timers), reducing human error or missed checks.



3\. Time-Saving:



Saves admins from manual checks, freeing them to focus on more complex tasks.



4\. Historical Data \& Trend Analysis:



Automated monitoring can log data over time, allowing admins to identify trends or predict when upgrades may be needed.



5\. Automated Responses:



Monitoring scripts can trigger automatic actions, e.g., restarting a service, clearing cache, or sending notifications.



6\. Scalability:



Essential in large environments with many servers, where manual monitoring is impractical.
